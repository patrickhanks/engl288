# A Hydration Manifesto

As mammals it is essential for humans to stay hydrated. Yet, in our modern society we have become anemic to hydration. Overly sugary and processed drinks are preferred over water. Companies seek to control the rights to the nectar of life. The way we structure our daily lives discourages people from staying sufficiently hydrated so they can avoid taking frequent trips to the bathroom. Therefore, we must change society to reaffirm our necessity on and love of water. 

## The Four Pillars of Hydration

### 1.	End Hydrodipsophobia

Hatred for tap water is widespread. Snobbish attitudes towards bottled water are pervasive. People turn to caffeinated beverages, sugary beverages, and corrupted H2O products. If guests come over to your house it is considered rude to only offer them water. We gather to drink coffee, tea, or alcohol for social experiences. We must end this fear of drinking water—Hydrodipsophobia.

### 2.	End Urophobia

From a young age, in schools, children face pressure to not go to the bathroom. If teachers believe their pupils are going to the bathroom too frequently then they are reprimanded. As we become adults, we face similar pressure. Many employers count the time that their employees spend on “personal” matters like going to the bathroom. Employees can get fired for going to the bathroom too much. No one should be shamed or penalized for taking breaks to urinate. In fact, quite the opposite if one is properly staying hydrated then they very likely will be urinating frequently. This fear of going to the bathroom must end.

### 3.	Restore the Right to (Good) Water

Despite the necessity of water for life, not every person in our country has access to clean, safe, and good water. The water crisis in Flint, MI was a major event in the news several years ago. Unfortunately, there are other cities that face the challenges of aging water systems and piping, mismanagement, and steep replacement costs. We must ensure that every person has the right and access to safe, clean, and good drinking water. 

### 4.	Support Water Supremacy

There is no better liquid fit for human consumption that water. The nectar of life is essential to our well-being. Other beverages are not necessary. Some even are bad for our health. Yet, we continue to drink poison and allow it to be made and sold. We must pledge our collective will and devotion to achieving water supremacy.
